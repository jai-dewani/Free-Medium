# Free-Medium

Automatically open Medium blogs (and similar ones) on Incognito tab to avoide unnecessary hassle of facing this... :sad:

> **Note:** Currently it only works when you open the medium link in a new tab. Better to use `Ctrl  + Left Click` to open the link in the new tab and then the extension will close it and open it in a incognito window. 

I am still working on adding functionalities like 

- [ ] Now having to open a new tab to make the extension work 
- [ ] Open multiple medium tabs in a same incognito window insted on seprate windows 
- [ ] Add more website to the list which can benifit from this functionality
