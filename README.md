# Free-Medium

Automatically open Medium blogs (and similar ones) on the Incognito tab to avoid unnecessary hassle of facing this... :face_with_head_bandage:

> **Note:** Currently it only works when you open the medium link in a new tab. Better to use `Ctrl  + Left Click` to open the link in the new tab and then the extension will close it and open it in an incognito window. 

## I am still working on adding functionalities like 


- [ ] Make the extension work without opening the link in a new tab [#1][i1]
- [ ] Add more website to the list which can benefit from this functionality [#2][i2]
- [ ] Allow opening of multiple medium tabs in the same incognito window instead of on separate windows [#3][i3]
